## Description
The purpose of this project is to automate the process of creating a README file. After the file is executed in a node terminal, the javascript file will use the inquirer module to prompt the user with various questions. These questions pertain to different sections of a standard REAMDE file. The user will then answer each question, which will provide the content that makes up the user's README file. After the data is collected, the index.js file uses the fs module to create and write the user-defined data to the README file. After all questions have been answered, a completed README file will appear in the same directory as the index.js file.
## Installation Instructions
The user will need to install a couple different modules to successfully use this application. Those required modules are as follows: fs and inquirer.
## Usage Information
After the modules are installed, the user will need to access the directory, which contains the index.js file, in their CLI. Then they can simple execute the 'node index.js' command and the program will take care of the rest!
